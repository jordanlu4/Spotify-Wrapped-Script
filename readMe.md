*FINISHED*
This is another spotify script I wrote in python that acts like the yearly "Spotify Wrapped" feature. With this program, you won't have to wait. At your command, you have the ability to check your top artists and tracks within a certain period, and turn it
into a playlist on your actual spotify application!
